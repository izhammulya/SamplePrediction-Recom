For the Result, it can be seen on the simple dashboard at https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/d9a5a3a4-90ae-48eb-bec6-af8a26035ba1

In Predictive Analytics, 4 analytics were involving, including Decision Tree, GaussianNB,KNN, and Random Forest. 
After evaluating the performance of model, the best model for the dataset was Decision Tree.

For Recommendation system, surprise framework was utilized because we have explicit ratings. Among 3 models (SVD, KNN and matrics Factorization),
matrics Factorization outperforms among the others. Hence, this is the final model.
